    The Orphanet nomenclature is a multilingual, standardised, controlled medical terminology specific to rare diseases, that includes all clinical entities registered in the Orphanet database (www.orpha.net). Each clinical entity (disorder, group of disorders, or subtype of a disorder) is associated with a unique numerical identifier named ORPHAcode, as well as a preferred term, synonyms, and a definition.  In the frame of the RD-CODE project, co-funded by the European Unionâ€™s Third Health Program, Orphanet developped this API. It intends to support Member States in the implementation of the ORPHA nomenclature to rare diseases-specific codification systems. Starting with countries that have no systematic implementation of the Orpha codification yet, but that are actively committed already in doing so, this project will provide a sufficient real-world implementation experience to be captured by other countries in the future.
